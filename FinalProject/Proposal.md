My final project will be to render the Earth's solar system.   I'll include all nine planets, with a few having moons.  Each planet will be texture mapped to give it a realistic look, and the planets will orbit the sun at rates proportional to their planetary years.  Similarly, each planet's size will be relative to each other, but still artistically pleasing.  As a stretch goal, I'll render a star field behind all the planets.

A sequence of steps for implementing your project.  You have five weeks for completing the project (presentations will be done in class on May 1st),  (that does not include this coming week, which is for writing this proposal) so breakdown your project into five chunks.  For example:
Week 1: Collect planetary information, images for each planet, and find a model of a sphere.

Week 2: Complete the necessary code to render the sphere, applying the appropriate texture map.

Week 3: Position and scale each planet relative to the sun, using a matrix stack.  This will include specifying an appropriate viewing and projection transform.  I'll focus on getting the relative distances between planets correct, but won't have animated orbits at this stage.

Week 4: Add motion for the planets, including daily (i.e., planetary spin) and yearly (i.e., orbit around the sun) rotations.  I'll also add a few moons orbiting around some planets.

Week 5: (Stretch goal) Add a star field to the cosmos by randomly positioning various shades of gray points on a sphere larger than the entire solar system (including rotation
