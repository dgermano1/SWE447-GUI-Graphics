          Final Project Proposal

My final project idea is to make a screen the user can interact with. I'm thinking when the user moves their mouse on the screen. a texture will appear where their mouse was. I will try to restrain where the user can interact with on the page. My stretch goal would be to be able to stop and restart the textures. 

Week 1: Research about how to track the mouse position and create objects and it's position. 
        Create outline.

Week 2: Get the texture code to work.

Week 3: Get the solvers to work.

Week 4: Get jQuery and Sizzle in the project.

Week 5: Finish project.
          -Stretch: User has extended control of the project by being able to stop and reset it. 
          
          
Implementation: THREE.js, or maybe another .js file that is helpful for this kind of work.
